# About Our Product

Our product is an automatic voice-controlled waste dispenser designed for smart homes. It utilizes Python's audio library and integrates with Google's API to enable voice input through a microphone connected to a Raspberry Pi. The voice input is then categorized using a supervised machine learning algorithm, specifically the Naïve Bayes classifier, into the categories of garbage, compost, or recycling. The learning algorithm was trained using a self-curated list of 1000s of items.

Once the input is categorized by the machine learning algorithm, the Raspberry Pi sends the corresponding command of "waste," "recycling," or "compost" to an Arduino Mega board, which uses the input to open the corresponding opening of the correct waste bin by utilizing the appropriate servo motor. This ensures that waste is properly disposed of based on its category.

Our product aligns with our team's belief in environmental friendliness and technology. By automating waste disposal and categorization, we aim to promote efficient recycling practices and reduce environmental impact.

## Key Features

- Voice-controlled operation: Users can effortlessly control the waste dispenser by speaking commands, making waste disposal convenient and hands-free.
- Machine learning categorization: The Naïve Bayes classifier accurately categorizes voice input into garbage, compost, or recycling, ensuring proper waste disposal.
- Raspberry Pi integration: The Raspberry Pi serves as the central processing unit, receiving voice input, categorizing it, and sending commands to the Arduino Mega board.
- Arduino Mega board control: The Arduino Mega board controls the opening of the correct waste bin based on the categorized input, ensuring accurate waste disposal.

## Benefits

- Convenience: Voice-controlled operation eliminates the need for physical interaction, making waste disposal effortless and hygienic.
- Efficient waste management: The machine learning categorization ensures that waste is disposed of correctly, promoting recycling and reducing environmental impact.
- Smart home integration: Our product is designed for smart homes, seamlessly integrating with existing smart home systems and enhancing overall home automation.
